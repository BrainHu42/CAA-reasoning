Even if it's hot outside, a small dog may pant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Heat stress**: Small dogs can quickly overheat due to their compact size and high metabolic rate. As the temperature rises, their body temperature can increase rapidly, leading to panting as a way to cool down.\n2. **Respiratory system**: Small dogs have a higher respiratory rate than larger dogs, which means",
