I believe that NLP research today focuses too much on scaling up machine learning models. While scaling up NLP models has achieved state-of-the-art results, this has caused researchers to neglect other crucial aspects of NLP such as interpretability, explainability and theoretical analysis of algorithms. I think that NLP research should also focus on these other important aspects along with scaling up models.
